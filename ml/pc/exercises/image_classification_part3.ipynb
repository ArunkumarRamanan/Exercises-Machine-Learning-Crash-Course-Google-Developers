This versatility and repurposability of convnets is one of the most interesting aspects of deep learning.\n",

One way to increase performance even further is to \"fine-tune\" the weights of the top layers of the pretrained model alongside the training of the top-level classifier. A couple of important notes on fine-tuning:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fine-tuning should only be attempted *after* you have trained the top-level classifier with the pretrained model set to non-trainable**. If you add a randomly initialized classifier on top of a pretrained model and attempt to train all layers jointly, the magnitude of the gradient updates will be too large (due to the random weights from the classifier), and your pretrained model will just forget everything it has learned.\n",
        "- Additionally, we **fine-tune only the *top layers* of the pre-trained model** rather than all layers of the pretrained model because, in a convnet, the higher up a layer is, the more specialized it is. The first few layers in a convnet learn very simple and generic features, which generalize to almost all types of images. But as you go higher up, the features are increasingly specific to the dataset that the model is trained on. The goal of fine-tuning is to adapt these specialized features to work with the new dataset.\n",
