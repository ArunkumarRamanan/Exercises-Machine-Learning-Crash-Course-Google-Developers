        "When we achieve the exact same results by using an [`embedding_column`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column) of size $d$, we look up and add up just the embeddings corresponding to the three features present in our example input of \"`great`\", \"`beautiful`\", \"`excellent`\": $(1 \\times d) + (1 \\times d) + (1 \\times d)$. Since the weights for the features that are absent are multiplied by zero in the vector-matrix multiply, they do not contribute to the result. Weights for the features that are present are multiplied by 1 in the vector-matrix multiply. Thus, adding the weights obtained via the embedding lookup will lead to the same result as in the vector-matrix-multiply.\n",

        "When using an embedding, computing the embedding lookup is an $O(s * d)$ computation, which is computationally much more efficient than the $O(V * d)$ cost for the `indicator_column` in sparse data for which $s$ is much smaller than $V$. (Remember, these embeddings are being learned. In any given training iteration it is the current weights that are being looked up.)"

        "As we saw in **Task 3**, by using an `embedding_column` in training the `DNNClassifier`, our model learns a low-dimensional representation for the features, where the dot product defines a similarity metric tailored to the desired task. In this example, terms that are used similarly in the context of movie reviews (e.g., `\"great\"` and `\"excellent\"`) will be closer to each other the embedding space (i.e., have a large dot product), and terms that are dissimilar (e.g., `\"great\"` and `\"bad\"`) will be farther away from each other in the embedding space (i.e., have a small dot product)."
